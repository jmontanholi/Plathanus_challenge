# This is a repository that stores three challenges for the Plathanus interview process.

- In the first Exercise I built a function that receives a number and retrieves the same number in roman algarisms.
- The second exercise is a index page for apartments inspired in the [tabas](https://tabas.com/apartments/sao-paulo?utf8=âœ“&search%5Bmin_price%5D=4792&search%5Bmax_price%5D=29990&commit=Apply+Filters&search%5Bordering%5D=&search%5Bcheck_in%5D=&search%5Bcheck_out%5D=) website.
- The third and las exercise is a function that clears an array of dates and returns only complete dates.
